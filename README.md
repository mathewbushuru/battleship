<h1 align="center"> Battleship </h1>

The main purpose of this project is to explore testing in React while creating a Battleship game. I aim to maintain 100% test coverage throughout development. I'm using `Vitest` as the unit testing framework, `JSDOM` as the running environment for the tests, and a combination of `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/jest-dom` for react testing utilities.
